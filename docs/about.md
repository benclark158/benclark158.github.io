### Education

#### John Spendluffe Technology College

At JSTC I studied my GCSEs and I achieved 11 A* to C including maths, English and triple science.

JSTC is also where I completed my Bronze Duke of Edinbough Award. I also took part in a number of extra curricular activities such as Rock Challenge. I often too photos for the school such as at sports days and some events.

#### Lincoln University Technical College

At Lincoln UTC I studied towards my A-level qualification. Over my two years at the UTC I studied Physics, Maths and Computing (Computer Science), in which I received CBB grades respectively. I also completed an Extended Project Qualification in which I was awarded an A*. 

During my time at Lincoln UTC I developed my strength and interest in computer science. Thanks to this in the second year of my studies I took part in two game jams, a local one hosted by the University of Lincoln and the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/).

During these two years I also developed a keen interest for cinematography. It was at UTC that I made by first videos and short "productions" to advertise the UTC and what things had happened during that academic year. I also made a few, shorter video for specific events that the UTC held. Such as the official opening and the first week in a new building. These can all be found in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhHvdVLwUP3RiGEq0NlH55STttWH1ym7n).

#### University of Nottingham

The University of Nottingham is the place that I am currently studying. I am currently (2017) in my second year of a computer science with artificial intelligence degree of which I will be graduating in 2020. 

In my first year at university I accomplished a first overall.
