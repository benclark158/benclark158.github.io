For this project I was tasked with creating a Twitter interface that allows you to tweet at a user of your choice, and see tweets from a specific search term.

This project was given to me as I wanted to do some programming at the start of my 2nd year doing A-level computer science. I programmed this application using C# using Visual Studio to create part of the interface, however most of this was done procedurally. 

This was quite a simple project to produce, however making sense of the Twitter API did take time, luckily though my computer science teacher had previously used the exact same API.
