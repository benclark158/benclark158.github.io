This project was done as part of one of my first year modules, G51DBI. In this module we studied databases and interfaces, along with webdesign/programming. In this piece of coursework we was given the breif that we had to develop a website that allowed a user to add, remove and edit artists, CDs and tracks via a webpage/site. This data would be then be saved in a database.

There were a few other requirements such as including ajax, jQuery and implementing a method of searching the records. But appart from that there were no limits on the coursework and we were free to add additional features in order to gain more marks.

At the end of the project I had managed to fully implement the following features:
 * Adding artists/CDs/Tracks
 * Editing artists/CDs/Tracks
 * Removing artists/CDs/Tracks
 * Viewing artists/CDs/Tracks
 * Searching data sets (artists/CDs/Tracks)
 * Adding artists/CDs/Tracks from iTunes
 * Viewing additional information about albums/tracks loaded from iTunes
 * Automatically adding all of the tracks and albums done by a specific artist from iTunes
 * Database Statistics - including graphs showing change in statistics over time.
 * Resetting/clearing of database

In the final version of the site, many of the features were dependant on both Javascipt and jQuery, however if either of these we disabled then I implemented features/systems that allowed the core features of the site to function.

 In this project 3 external APIs were used:
  * Highcharts API - for statistic graphs
  * iTunes API - to get data on artists/CDs/tracks
  * Fixer.io API - to convert iTunes costs to configured currency

Overall, I am very proud of the system that I built and submitted.
