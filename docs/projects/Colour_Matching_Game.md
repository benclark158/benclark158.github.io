This simple game was developed as part of my first year computer science course. In the second year, we had a module of Programming Paradigms, in this we learnt both Haskell and Java (Which I already knew) Our final piece of coursework for the Java proportion of the module we had to make a matching colours game.

In this, the game board would be randomly generated, hence allowing the board to change between games. The 2 players would then click two tiles each and the game would track how many correct tiles each player had got correct. Once all tiles had been paired, the game would display the score and tell both players who the winner was. 

Personally, I found this game fairly easy to implement, due to my past experience with Java. Overall, I developed two versions of this game, first was my version of the game, that I created based purely of the screenshots and software outline that was provided in the coursework specification. The second version was created as per the module convenors step my step implementation specification.
