This project was originally part of a larger project, as I wanted a way for a system to automatically calculate a chemical reaction based off of physical properties, rather than having to manually program each chemical reaction into the system. Overtime, this section became its own project and system.

This system uses atomic properties of each atom/element to determine the number of electrons in each shell (specifically the outer shell) of each atom. It is then used to determine if two (or more) atoms will react together. 

The system will then determine the type of reaction that that is taking place, decomposition/synthesis etc. It will then 'perform' the reaction and generate a resulting compound/chemical. The chemical equation for the reaction will then be displayed to the screen. 

I did attempt to implement a function that allowed for the equation to balance, if it was in-balanced. However I never had a chance to fully complete this part.

Overall, this system isn't complete to any standard, while it does perform a high majority of chemical reactions, there are a number that don't work with the system. There are also some reactions that the program can compute but don't actually happen in real life. However, I do look forward to finding time to work on this project again, hopefully when we break from University for Christmas (2017).

This project was first started about 3/4 years ago, and only limited developments have been done due to other commitments. However, I do look forward to completing the project, and potentially interfacing it with this website.
