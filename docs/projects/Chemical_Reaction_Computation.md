  <h1>Chemical Reaction Computation</h1>

This project was originally part of a larger project, as I wanted a way for a system to automatically calculate a chemical reaction based off of physical properties, rather than having to manually program each chemical reaction into the system. Overtime, this section became its own project and system.
