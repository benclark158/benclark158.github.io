## About Me

Hello, My name is Ben Clark, I am a second-year student at the University of Nottingham; where I am studying Computer Science with Artificial Inteligence.

I am confident in saying that I am confident and practiced in a number of programming languages. However I believe that I my strongest language is Java, as that was the lanuage that I first learnt to program with. Since begining to program I have developed a number of projects, for various uses or simply just because.
